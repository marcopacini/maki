# Maki

maki-lang or just Maki is a programming language built for fun completely written in Go. It is not **absolutely** 
production ready and ~~probably~~ will never be.

```
io.println("Hello, World!")
```
Maki ~~was written~~ is being written keeping in mind that is should be easy to read. So the implementation choices
are very affected by KISS principle.

#### Nice to have

- `switch` statement
- `break` statement
- `continue` statement

## Credits

This project owe much indeed to @munificient's book: Crafting Interpreters. In fact Maki is deeply inspired by Lox.
